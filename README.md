JavaScript library for calculating beats per minute.

:stopwatch: Uses `performance.now()` by default, override with your own timestamps if necessary  
:recycle: Automatically resets when pausing between taps

## Usage

```js
import { Counter } from 'bpm-counter';
const counter = new Counter();
```

Call the `tap()` method with a touch or click event.

```js
counter.tap();
```

Optionally you can pass timestamps in ms.

```js
counter.tap(0);
counter.tap(500);
counter.tap(1000);
counter.tap(1500);
```

Or initialize with an array of timestamps in ms.

```js
const counter = new Counter([0, 500, 1000, 1500]);
```

To read the BPM:

```js
counter.bpm;
```

Waiting 1.5 \* average interval length will reset the counter. To reset manually:

```js
counter.reset();
```

## Installation

```sh
yarn add bpm-counter
```

or

```sh
npm install bpm-counter
```
